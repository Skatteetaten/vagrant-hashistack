# Starter template for `fredrikhgrelland/hashistack`

This repository can be used as a base for developing services on the hashistack.
On github, you may use the ["Use this template"](https://github.com/fredrikhgrelland/vagrant-hashistack-template/generate) button to generate a new repository from this template.

If you found this in `fredrikhgrelland/vagrant-hashistack`, you may be interested in this separate repository [vagrant-hashistack-template](https://github.com/fredrikhgrelland/vagrant-hashistack-template/generate) button to start a new repository from this repo

## Customizing and using the vagrant box
The vagrant box ships with a default startup scheme. It will run an ansible playbook to start all services.
You may change the hashistack configuration or add aditional pre and post steps to the startup procedure to match your needs.

### Overriding and extending the configuration of the hashistack

- consul [vagrant/conf/hashistack/consul/99-override.hcl](vagrant/conf/hashistack/consul/99-override.hcl)
- nomad [vagrant/conf/hashistack/nomad/99-override.hcl](vagrant/conf/hashistack/nomad/99-override.hcl)
- vault [vagrant/conf/hashistack/vault/99-override.hcl](vagrant/conf/hashistack/vault/99-override.hcl)

You may edit the `99-override.hcl` or add your own.
Any valid configuration added to these directories will be added to their respective services' configuration, in lexical order.

#### Nomad ACLs
To toggle ACLs in nomad you need to supply a `env.yml` file in the same directory as your Vagrantfile containing the line:
```yaml
nomad_acl: true
```

When ACLs in Nomad are enabled the bootstrap token will be available in vault under `secret/nomad/management-token` with the two key-value pairs `accessor-id` and `secret-id`. `secret-id` is the token itself. These can be accessed in several ways:
- From inside the vagrant box with `vault kv get secret/nomad-bootstrap-token` (you may need to run `export VAULT_TOKEN=master` and `export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200` first, if they are not already set).
- From local machine with `vagrant ssh -c "VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 VAULT_TOKEN=master vault kv get secret/nomad-bootstrap-token"`
- By going to vault's UI on `localhost:8200`, and signing in with the root token.

#### Consul default ACL policy
Refer to [config variations](#config-variations) on how to change Consul's default ACL policy.

#### Config variations
We provide some config variations as additional functionality, which you may want to use. To see all supported variables, go to [default_vars.yml](../ansible/load_env_vars.yml)
Currently supported ways to edit these variables:
```text
* ACL default policy for consul (deny or allow)
```
To choose other config variation you need to override ansible variables. There are two options how to override ansible variables:
* First option via `ANSIBLE_AGRS`
```bash
ANSIBLE_ARGS='--extra-vars "consul_agent_acl_default_policy=deny"' vagrant up --provision
```
* Second option via prestart, adding fact in `vagrant/conf/ansible/playbooks/prestart/0-example.yml`
```yaml
# Option 2 how to turn on ACL
# [ACL] Set 'deny' default policy for consul agent
- set_fact: consul_agent_acl_default_policy="deny"
```

#### Consul secrets engine
If `consul_agent_acl_default_policy="deny"` has value `deny`, it will also enable [consul secrets engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/consul) in vault.  
Ansible will provision additional custom roles (admin-team, dev-team), [policies](../ansible/templates/consul-policies) and tokens for test purpose with different access level.

How to generate token:
```text
# generate token for dev team member
vagrant ssh -c 'VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 VAULT_TOKEN=master vault read consul/creds/dev-team'

# generate token for admin team member
vagrant ssh -c 'VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200 VAULT_TOKEN=master vault read consul/creds/admin-team'
```

*Tokens can be used to access UI (different access level depends on role)

### Pre- and post-startup ansible playbooks
This vagrant box will execute ansible playbooks put in two special directories [vagrant/conf/ansible/playbooks/prestart](vagrant/conf/ansible/playbooks/prestart) and [vagrant/conf/ansible/playbooks/poststart](vagrant/conf/ansible/playbooks/poststart). These playbooks will be executed before and after the box's bundled startup sequence, respectively. This gives the flexibility to configure all aspects of the hashistack as well as run tasks needed for tests or demo purposes as part of `vagrant up` Note; The playbooks are included into the main run, so the syntax in the [example](vagrant/conf/ansible/playbooks/prestart/0-example.yml) must be followed..  
They will be run in lexical order, and prefixing with numbers is a good way to get the order you want.

### Vagrant box life-cycle
![img](vagrant/docs/life-cycle.png)
1. `install.yml` - installing required software
2. `default_vars.yml` - setup default ansible variables
3. `prestart/*.yml` - prestart scripts, running before hashistack software will start
4. `bootstrap.yml` - verify ansible variables and software configuration, run hashistack software & verify that it started correctly
5. `poststart/*.yml` - poststart scripts, running after hasistack software runs and ready
6. `ansible/playbook.yml` - user's provisioning playbook
